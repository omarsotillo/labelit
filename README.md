## Overview

With Labelit you are able to share labels of issues between projects in a flash! This is done to provide an easier interface than the one Github is providing which does not allow to share and take from famous repositories the labels.

#### Build Setup

To start:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To develop:

```bash
$ npm run dev
 ```

To build for production:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

To lint you code:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```
